A multi-page web application designed to automatically detect and moderate toxic comments in real-time, helping to create a safer environment for live streamers and their communities.

## üìñ About The Project

Online live streaming platforms often struggle with toxic, offensive, or abusive comments in their chat feeds. Manual moderation is often impractical during high-traffic sessions. This project solves that problem by providing an automated moderation assistant.

It uses a sophisticated machine learning model (`unitary/toxic-bert`) to analyze chat messages and classify them across multiple toxicity categories. The results are stored in a database and visualized on a powerful analytics dashboard, giving moderators a high-level view of their community's health.
